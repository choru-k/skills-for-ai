# Run Preflight Checklist

Check before generation:
- source-of-truth quality (avoid weak summaries)
- specificity (exact paths/errors where relevant)
- completeness (success criteria + assumptions)
- security (no secrets)
- verification statement (how state was confirmed)

If critical context is missing, ask user before proceeding.
