# Validation Rubric

Score each dimension 1-5.

## 1. Problem Fit
Does this solve a real pain in your workflow?

## 2. Evidence Strength
Is the claim supported by examples, data, or reliable practice?

## 3. Compatibility
Does it fit your harness constraints (Pi/Claude/Codex), tools, and repository layout?

## 4. Operational Cost
How much complexity/maintenance does adoption add?

## 5. Reversibility
Can you roll it back safely if it does not work?

## Verdict Rule (simple)

- **valid**: mostly 4-5, no critical risk
- **valid-with-constraints**: promising but needs pilot/scope limits
- **not-valid**: weak fit or high risk
- **unknown**: insufficient information

## Confidence

- **high**: direct evidence + local confirmation
- **medium**: reasonable logic, limited local testing
- **low**: mostly theoretical
