# Status Management Actions

Based on user request, support:

1. review ticket status
2. update plans or re-run `/superplan` with same `target_directory`
3. add notes/task files
4. archive completed ticket:
   `mv ~/Desktop/choru/choru-notes/1-projects/work/CENG-XXXX ~/Desktop/choru/choru-notes/4-archive/work/`
5. reopen archived ticket by moving it back to `1-projects/work/`

Always preserve existing notes/progress.
