# Skill Playbook Index

Start here. This graph helps evaluate outside ideas, track lifecycle status, and maintain best practices over time.

## Workflow MOC

- [[workflow]] — end-to-end process and decision gates

## Standards MOC

- [[standards]] — approved practices and conventions

## Core Nodes

- [[workflow-analyze-validate-decide-adopt]] — canonical flow
- [[validation-rubric]] — validity scoring
- [[status-lifecycle]] — status model and transitions
- [[review-best-practices]] — periodic review process

## Adopted Best Practices

- [[bp-skill-graph-post]] — thin router SKILL.md + linked graph nodes for complex skills
- [[bp-personal-brain-os-filesystem]] — filesystem-first context architecture with progressive disclosure and scope constraints

## Active Candidates

- [[candidate-claude-md-content-scope]] — keep as proposed; revisit after additional validation
