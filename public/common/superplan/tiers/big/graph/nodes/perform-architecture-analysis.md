# Perform Architecture Analysis

Before writing artifacts:
- define system boundaries
- define high-level data flow
- capture key decisions and alternatives
- identify major risks + mitigations
- split work into clear executable phases

Use references as needed: `tiers/big/references/architecture-template.md`.
