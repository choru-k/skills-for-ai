# Synthesis Strategy

Use `reference/synthesis-guide.md` as the detailed source of truth.

## Core Rules

- Merge near-identical conclusions.
- Highlight meaningful disagreements.
- Preserve unique insights even without consensus.
- Always include raw response file paths for traceability.

## Output Shape

1. Grouped response summary (consensus vs divergence)
2. Your synthesis with confidence level
3. Follow-up recommendation (optional next action)

## Confidence Guidance

- High: broad agreement + strong reasoning
- Medium: mixed but explainable differences
- Low: sparse or low-quality responses
